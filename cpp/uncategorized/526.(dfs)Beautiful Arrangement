Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is
constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position 
(1 ≤ i ≤ N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
Note:
N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.
